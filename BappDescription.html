<p>Burp Suite 2020.12 replaced the old Look and Feel classes with FlatLaf, an open source Look and Feel class which also supports 3rd party themes developed for the IntelliJ Platform.</p>
<p>This extension allows you to use these themes in Burp Suite, and includes a number of bundled themes to try.</p>

<p>Limitations</p>

<p>Since Burp uses a number of custom GUI elements, PortSwigger extended the default Look and Feel classes with a number of additional properties. In order to try to make these blend in, I've tried to find standard elements who's colors can be used to replace the custom properties. Some themes might not have these properties, or might not fit the theme perfectly. If there are any elements which don't fit, please submit an issue on GitHub including the theme name, and a screenshot.</p>
